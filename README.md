What it does: One of the main functions of our app is the ability for the users to upload receipts whenever they shop and the website to be able to extract data from the receipts and automatically categorize them for budget tracking. This includes both pictures of physical receipts or a screenshot of payment confirmation online. The website holds a history of all the receipts and updates the data visualizations based on the spending. The app ultimately encourages the user to stay within their set budgets and save more money monthly, so that they can spend that on paying back their loan. Our website doesnâ€™t only tell the people to pay back the loan but guides them along the way to do so. The website performs calculations in order to determine how much loan they still have left to pay and gives a visual representation of a rocket landing on planets to show their loan repayment journey and how close they are to achieving their goal.
